What is a FIFO (Named Pipe)?

FIFO stands for First In First Out, also called a named pipe.

Unlike anonymous pipes, which only work between related processes (parent-child), FIFOs allow unrelated processes to communicate.

It exists as a special file in the filesystem. Processes can open it like a normal file for reading or writing.

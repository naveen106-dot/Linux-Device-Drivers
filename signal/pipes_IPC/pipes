A pipe is a mechanism for communication between processes in Linux/Unix. It allows one process to send data to another process in a unidirectional flow (one-way).

Full-duplex communication (two-way) requires two pipes.

Pipes are implemented by the kernel using a buffer in memory.

Typically used between parent and child processes created by fork().

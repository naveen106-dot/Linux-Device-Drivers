A signal is a software interrupt sent to a process.

Used to notify a process about an event (like Ctrl+C, segmentation fault, etc.).

Common signals:

SIGINT (Interrupt – Ctrl+C)

SIGTERM (Termination)

SIGKILL (Kill – cannot be caught)

SIGUSR1, SIGUSR2 (User-defined signals)

You can handle a signal using signal() or sigaction() system calls.
